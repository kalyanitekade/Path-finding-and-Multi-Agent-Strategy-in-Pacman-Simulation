#CSE 471 Project 
# Path-finding-and-Multi-Agent-Strategy-in-Pacman-Simulation

The project involves designing reflex agents that decide their actions based on game state analysis, including ghost and food positions.  

Algorithms like Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Expectimax are implemented for decision-making in adversarial environments.
